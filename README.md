# Quizzical

A single page React app that generates 5 General Knowledge trivia questions.

This project is part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career path. I was given a Figma comp and I wrote all the code and used Vite to do the local development.

I originally matched the Figma comp exactly but I was finding the fonts were too small on the buttons and were particularly hard to click on mobile.
